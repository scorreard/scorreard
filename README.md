# Hello world 👋 👩‍💻 👩‍🔬


I'm Solenne, a molecular biologist and a bioinformatician passionate about human and non-human genomes. 
Driven by the complexity of genomes 🧬, I like to dive into the DNA and identify patterns responsible for specific phenotypes. 


## Projects

### Current projects

Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow in the <a href="https://cisreg.ca">Wasserman lab</a> working on the development of an Indigenous Background Variant Library within the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/silent-genomes-project">Silent Genomes Project</a>. A Background Variant Library (BVL) is a list or collection of all the DNA variants in a group of people without severe genetic conditions, which helps to determine variants that are common or rare in the general population. If a variant is common in a group of 'healthy' people without severe genetic conditions, it is less likely to be responsible for a rare disease.

### Past projects

In the past, I studied dog genomes 🐶 (mostly the non-coding part) to find variants implicated in epilepsy, but also phenotypic charcteristic such as morphology or coat color.
