# Hello world 👋 👩‍💻 👩‍🔬

I'm Solenne, a molecular biologist and a bioinformatician passionate about the complexity of human and non-human genomes 🧬.

I am driven by the will to use genomic to help naviguate some of today's worlwide challenges, such as ensuring equal access to personalized medicine to everyone around the globe, regardless of their origin or economic background, or study climate change repercussions on earth biodiversity and fresh water / food supply to help prevent future dramatic events.

## Projects

### Current projects

Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow in the <a href="https://cisreg.ca">Wasserman lab</a> working on the <a href="https://www.bcchr.ca/silent-genomes-project">Silent Genomes Project</a>. The overall goal of the Silent Genomes project is to reduce health care disparities and improve diagnostic success for children with genetic diseases from Indigenous populations in Canada. Within this large project, I focus on the development of the Indigenous Background Variant Library, which is a database of DNA varaints present in a group of people without severe genetic conditions, which will help to determine variants that are common or rare in the general population, and therefore, help diagnosis of rare diseases in these populations.

### Past projects

In the past, I studied dog genomes 🐶 (mostly the non-coding part) to find and caracterize variants implicated in neurological disorders, but also varaints implicated in phenotypic charcteristic such as morphology or coat color.

Why the dog genome? 
Over the last few centuries, several hundred dog breeds have been artificially selected through intense breeding, resulting in the modern dog population having the widest polymorphism spectrum in terms of body shape, behavior and aptitude among mammals. Unfortunately, this diversification has predisposed most breeds to specific diseases of genetic origin (Galibert and André, 2006). Studying the dog genome can help understand diseases and other phenotypes, and have an impact for two species : Humans, and human "best-friends".
